    <p>This is the beginning of a paragraph for my html and css class. The goal for this assignemnt is to change how the first letter, or the first line, looks in comparison to the rest of the paragraph. I think this is pretty cool. THis also reminds me of when I would read in grade school. The first letter of paragraphs were made larger than the rest of the capital letters in that paragraph. </p>
